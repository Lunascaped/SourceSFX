The visual relationship between the sky, the water, and the rocks is something we could not achieve without HDR. In order for high dynamic range to correctly simulate the light's interaction with the surfaces around you, like these wet rocks, we needed more precise information about the surfaces than we've had in the past. So now, going forward, we're modelling textures in 3D packages to ensure that the physical information encoded in the texture allows HDR to correctly bounce light off the surface. We also design the colors and values of each surface to ensure they will be correct across all exposure levels.","commentarySpeaker":"Viktor Antonov"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\commentary\\comm_character.wav","fileName":"comm_character.wav","category":"commentary","displayName":"comm_character.wav","caption":"The process of building characters in Half-Life 2 taught us many things. By the end, we believed we'd figured out a more effective process for designing and constructing characters. This fisherman is the first character we've built using that process. Design-wise, the fisherman was focused on showcasing HDR, and the way light falls on human skin. The highlights on his forehead and nose are good examples of specularity on human skin. You can see how the wrinkles on his cheeks, and around his eyes, are an example of how we can use normal maps to add depth. Production-wise, the fisherman was built using a similar process to the rocks you saw on the beach. We model the 3D character at a very high detail, then extract much of the physical information and store it in the textures.","commentarySpeaker":"Randy Lundeen"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\commentary\\comm_cliffside.wav","fileName":"comm_cliffside.wav","category":"commentary","displayName":"comm_cliffside.wav","caption":"The area you're currently entering is called the cliffside arena. We were particularly happy with the vertical cliffside in Half-Life 1, and regretted that we didn't iterate further on that concept in Half-Life 2. Vertical space allows us to force the player to deal with threats from above and below. We find that players focus their view on the direction they're travelling, so by using a cliffside, and having the player ascend it, we ensure the player will look up and be prepared for enemies. If the player's path was to move past the bottom of the cliffside, it would be unlikely he would notice the soldiers rappelling down from above. Dying from unknown threats never feels fair, and certainly isn't fun.","commentarySpeaker":"Robin Walker"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\commentary\\comm_courtyard.wav","fileName":"comm_courtyard.wav","category":"commentary","displayName":"comm_courtyard.wav","caption":"The courtyard in front of you is a space we call an Arena. Arenas are built to hold the player for a period of time, and usually contain combat or some other challenge. They often have multiple entry-points for enemies, along with a gate of some kind to prevent the player moving on, until the challenge has been completed. In this case, the arena is free of enemies until the player solves a puzzle, and triggers an alarm. This is a method that allows the player to explore the arena, and get a sense of its space before being forced to fight in it. It adds a sense of uneasiness to the player, who's expecting to be attacked now that they've reached the goal set for them at the start of the map. The break in action here is also a crucial part of the level's pacing. It allows the player to recover and explore the world a little, after being attacked on the way up the cliffside.","commentarySpeaker":"Robin Walker"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\commentary\\comm_hdr.wav","fileName":"comm_hdr.wav","category":"commentary","displayName":"comm_hdr.wav","caption":"With conventional rendering, seen here on the left, if something on the screen is 20% reflective, like the wet sand, then the maximum reflected brightness could only be 20% of the maximum brightness of your monitor.

But what we're finding now is we're moving into next-generation content we want to have them also have the ability to model the texture in three-dimensions. So, they'll often use a package like XSI to actually build geometry for these rocks. So the normal map is basically taking a high-res, 3D model and rendering that onto a 2D surface. This way we can create the illusion of an object having much higher polycount than it actually does. So, for instance for these rocks, it's completely flat surface, but the normal map is creating the illusion of them bumping up out of the sand.","commentarySpeaker":"Randy Lundeen"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\commentary\\comm_outro.wav","fileName":"comm_outro.wav","category":"commentary","displayName":"comm_outro.wav","caption":"This marks the end of the Lost Coast tour.

It's not hard to create interesting goals for the player, like stopping this machine from shelling the nearby village. But the action required by the player to solve the challenge needs to be fun as well.

The original design of the puzzle was based on the idea of the player and the fisherman co-operating together to solve something. This was a type of puzzle we'd always wanted to attempt in HL2. Unfortunately, as development on Lost Coast neared the end, and this puzzle still wasn't finished, we decided to cut it. It's always painful to remove work, so we've tried to evolve a process for making those kinds of decisions. For example, with this puzzle we asked ourselves 'Is this puzzle actually fun?', 'If not, how much work does it need to be fun?', 'Does this puzzle fit within the purpose of Lost Coast?', 'Would our customers appreciate this puzzle being finished more than they would appreciate, say, soldiers rappelling off the cliffside?'.

The easiest way to think about dynamic tonemapping is that it is a method of simulating the way the human eye reacts to light. In the real world, you've probably walked into a dark room and noticed your eye adjusting to the darkness, letting your see better after some time. Or you've walked out into a bright day, and been blinded by the sun, only to have your eye adjust and allow you to see normally. Your iris is adjusting itself in response to the amount of light hitting your eye. Dynamic tonemapping simulates this, by automatically adjusting the exposure of the scene to mimic the behavior of your iris. You can see this as the view moves from the dark tunnel to the bright sun, and back again. Here you can see the way we calculate the amount of light hitting the player's eyes. We take a snapshot of the scene, and extract the brightness levels to get the average level of light. Additionally, we consider light at the center of the screen more important than that at the edges, to better simulate the geometry of the eye.","commentarySpeaker":"Chris Green"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\commentary\\comm_water.wav","fileName":"comm_water.wav","category":"commentary","displayName":"comm_water.wav","caption":"Water presents us with a lot of rendering challenges.

You can see the reflection & refraction scenes in the two small windows onscreen. In the refraction, we calculate, per-pixel, how much water you're looking through to do a volumetric underwater fog, to simulate particulate matter. For our full HDR solution, we had to go through the entire engine and modify every bit of code that calculated light and color. For example, these water reflection & refraction renderings had to be improved to support the full range of contrast values.","commentarySpeaker":"Gary McTaggart"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_bequick.wav","fileName":"fish_bequick.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_bequick.wav","caption":"We'd better be quick, lad, or there'll be nothing left to save."},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cliffclimb01.wav","fileName":"fish_cliffclimb01.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cliffclimb01.wav","caption":"Watch your step up there, laddy!"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cliffclimb02.wav","fileName":"fish_cliffclimb02.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cliffclimb02.wav","caption":"Don't look down!"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cliffclimb03.wav","fileName":"fish_cliffclimb03.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cliffclimb03.wav","caption":"You're doin fine, lad!"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cometostolga.wav","fileName":"fish_cometostolga.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cometostolga.wav","caption":"Come on with me to St. Olga!"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cough01.wav","fileName":"fish_cough01.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cough01.wav","caption":"[Coughing, Throat clearing]"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cough02.wav","fileName":"fish_cough02.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cough02.wav","caption":"[Coughing, Throat clearing]"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cough03.wav","fileName":"fish_cough03.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cough03.wav","caption":"[Coughing, Throat clearing]"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_cough04.wav","fileName":"fish_cough04.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_cough04.wav","caption":"[Coughing, Throat clearing]"},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_crabpot01.wav","fileName":"fish_crabpot01.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_crabpot01.wav","caption":"Nothing sadder than an empty crab pot."},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_crabpot02.wav","fileName":"fish_crabpot02.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_crabpot02.wav","caption":"Leeches ate most of the crabs."},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_crabpot03.wav","fileName":"fish_crabpot03.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_crabpot03.wav","caption":"Be sure to put that back where you found it."},{"path":"sound\\lostcoast\\vo\\fisherman\\fish_crabpot04.wav","fileName":"fish_crabpot04.wav","category":"VO","displayName":"fish_crabpot04.wav","caption":"Stop messing around.
